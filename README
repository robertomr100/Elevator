PROJECT 3 - KERNEL MODULE PROGRAMMING - COP4610
GROUP MEMBERS:	- Roberto Mora


DUE DATE: MARCH 15, 2019

-----------------------------
Part 1: System Call Tracing

Files:			
				- Makefile
				- part1.c (where we create the syscalls)
				
Our program writes the 6 system calls that have to be added in. Works fine.

-----------------------------
Part 2: Kernel Module

Files:			
				- Makefile
				- my_xtime.c (module with proc read)

We are able to successfully initiate the module, and print the current time and 
time passed since the last call successfully. Works fine.

-----------------------------
Part 3: Elevator Scheduler

Files: 			
				- Makefile
				- wrapper.c (wrapper file for start elevator, issue request, and stop elevator)
				- elevator_move.c (elevator scheduling implementation)
				- init.c (initializes, exits, and writes necessary output to kernel module)

Issue(s):
Elevator does not pick up passengers from floor 1 and 10 only when 
direction is switched. Other than this, no other known bugs.
